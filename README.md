# password-generator

A Python application for generating usernames and passwords

## Username Generation

The username generator will generate up to 5 (to start) suggestions that people will be able to use for a username. The username it generates can either use a base as sort of a common element for a users username or it could generate usernames based on a theme. I plan to also let the user
select any restrictions so that way it doesn't give you something that won't work for a particular website. I may also use cheerio to access the site in question and get a list of the requirements

For example:

- TheBigChad
- Chadders42
- ElChadd9d
- FeefChad
- 48Chad67

## Password Generation

Password generation will give you 1 suggestion for a password at a time and these will be in an encrypted file that requires a key.

## GUI

The GUI will make all of this much easier and more effective
